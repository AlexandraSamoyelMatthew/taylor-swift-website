        Folklore is the eighth studio album by the American singer-songwriter Taylor Swift. It was a surprise album,
        released on July 24, 2020, via Republic Records. Following the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic in early
        2020, Swift canceled the concert tour for her seventh studio album Lover (2019). She conceived Folklore
        during quarantine as "a collection of songs and stories that flowed like a stream of consciousness", working
        with producers Aaron Dessner and Jack Antonoff virtually; Dessner and Antonoff operated from recording
        studios in the Hudson Valley and New York City, respectively, while Swift recorded her vocals in a home
        studio at her Los Angeles residence.<br>
        <br>
        Departing from the mainly upbeat pop production of its predecessors, Folklore consists of mellow ballads
        driven by piano, guitars, strings, and muted percussions, pursuing indie folk, alternative rock, and
        electro-acoustic styles. Influenced by the isolation of quarantine, Swift explores themes of escapism,
        empathy, nostalgia and romanticism in the album, using a set of characters, fictional narratives, and story
        arcs, in contrast to the autobiographical tone of her previous projects. The title was inspired by the
        lasting legacy of folk songs, whereas its visual aesthetic reflects cottagecore.<br>
        <br>
        Upon release, Folklore topped the charts in various countries and is certified platinum or higher in
        Australia, Denmark, New Zealand, Norway, Poland, and the United Kingdom. In the United States, it was
        Swift's seventh number-one album and spent eight weeks atop the US Billboard 200, and it became the
        best-selling album of 2020. Three of its tracks, "Cardigan", "The 1", and "Exile" featuring Bon Iver,
        reached the top 10 on music charts in eight countries, with the former becoming Swift's sixth number-one
        single on the US Billboard Hot 100.<br>
        <br>
        Folklore received widespread critical acclaim that centered on its emotional weight, poetic lyricism, and
        relaxed pace. Critics found its introspective essence timely for the pandemic and regarded its sound a bold
        reinvention of Swift's artistry. The album was featured on numerous 2020 year-end rankings and nominated for
        several awards, and Rolling Stone included it in their 2023 revision of the 500 Greatest Albums of All Time.
        It won Album of the Year at the 63rd Annual Grammy Awards, making Swift the first woman in history to win
        the honor three times. She discussed Folklore and performed it live in the Disney+ concert documentary
        Folklore: The Long Pond Studio Sessions, premiering on November 25, 2020, and released Folklore's sequel
        record, Evermore (2020), two weeks later. Several artists cite Folklore as a source of inspiration.<br>
