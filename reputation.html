            Reputation (stylized in all lowercase) is the sixth studio album by the American singer-songwriter Taylor
            Swift.
            It was released on November 10, 2017, as her last album with Big Machine Records. She conceived Reputation
            as a
            response to the media scrutiny on her private life and public image after her previous album, 1989 (2014),
            propelled her toward global stardom. <br>
            <br>
            Inspired by Swift's romantic relationships and tarnished media image caused by celebrity disputes, the songs
            on
            Reputation altogether form a linear narrative about a protagonist expressing anger and vengeance against
            wrongdoers and finding solace in a blossoming love. Produced largely by Swift, Jack Antonoff, Max Martin,
            and
            Shellback, Reputation is an electropop and R&B album with elements of urban styles such as hip hop, trap,
            and
            EDM. Its densely arranged electronic sound is characterized by programmed drum machines, pulsating
            synthesizers
            and bass, and manipulated vocals. <br>
            <br>
            Swift opted out of television and press interviews to promote Reputation. Before the album's release, she
            cleared out her website and social media accounts, which generated widespread media attention. The lead
            single
            "Look What You Made Me Do" topped charts worldwide, the single "Delicate" topped US airplay charts, and the
            Reputation Stadium Tour became the highest-grossing North American tour of all time. In the United States,
            Reputation was Swift's fourth consecutive album to sell one million first-week copies, spent four weeks atop
            the
            Billboard 200, and was certified triple platinum. The album also topped charts and received multi-platinum
            certifications in Australia, New Zealand, and the United Kingdom. <br>
            <br>
            When Reputation was first released, music critics generally praised Swift's intimate songwriting about love
            but
            were divided by the production and themes of fame and celebrity, which some described as harsh and
            derivative.<br>
            Some media publications deemed the album disappointing in the context of Swift's celebrity and the US
            political
            landscape. <br>
            Retrospective reviews opined that the initial reception was affected by the negative press and
            described the album as a work of artistic experimentation and evolution for Swift. Reputation was nominated
            for
            Best Pop Vocal Album at the 61st Annual Grammy Awards, and it was listed on Slant Magazine's list of the
            best
            albums of the 2010s. <br>
