            Taylor was hoping to release her second album and have a world tour and have fans come and sing her songs
            that she writes herself, and she wanted to contact with us.<br>
            She was able to release the album Fearless in November 11, 2008 and it achieved great success at that
            time.<br>
            There is no one who knows Taylor who does not know Love Story or You Belong with Me.<br>
            We are still with her until now, singing these two songs at the top of our lungs, dancing the fearless
            dance on fearless song, and making hearts by our hands when she says it's fearless.
            and the clap twice in You Belong With Me.<br>
            Taylor won four Grammy Awards and began her rise from this era
            Among them was the Album of the Year award she began to be nominated for many awards, including Vmas, Amas,
            and Billboard. <br>
            At the Vmas ceremony, when Taylor Lunter announced the winner of the award for Best Female Music Video,
            Taylor was competing with Beyoncé at the time.<br>
            A guy named Kanye West came on stage and said Taylor, I'm realy happy for you and I'll let you finish, but
            Beyoncé has the best
            videos all the time, he was saying she deserves it more than you.<br>
            Taylor, in her beginnings, was not an artist who was confident in herself and striving on her path with
            confidence. She thought that she was doing her best and that people would love her. Perhaps she was not
            prepared herself, that she would have haters who would fight her the longer she was in the spotlight, and
            that
            she would have to fight for her place and for herself and her effort. <br>
            So she felt at the time that she really didn't deserve it, but when Beyoncé won her award, she said that we
            have to support each other and help the new generation to give the best. The moment I won the first VMAS
            award,
            it was the most amazing ever. Come, Taylor, and have your moment.<br>
