            the first re-recorded album the first step from her project to return her copyrights
            released on April 9, 2021, by Republic Records. It is part of Swift's re-recording projects following
            the
            2019 dispute over the ownership of her back catalog released by Big Machine Records. Fearless (Taylor's
            Version) comprises re-recordings of the tracks on Swift's second studio album, Fearless (2008), the
            soundtrack single "Today Was a Fairytale" for the 2010 film Valentine's Day, and six previously
            unreleased
            "From the Vault" tracks.<br>
            <br>
            Fearless (Taylor's Version) is a country pop album composed of acoustic instruments such as guitars,
            banjo,
            fiddle, and strings. The lyrics are about Swift's adolescent reflections and feelings on love and
            heartbreak. Swift and Christopher Rowe produced the re-recorded tracks, and they feature identical
            arrangements as with the original but their instruments and vocals are more defined and controlled. Jack
            Antonoff and Aaron Dessner worked with Swift to produce the vault tracks, which have an indie-
            and-electronic-oriented soundscape brought by synthesizers and drum programming. Two vault tracks
            feature
            guest vocals from Maren Morris and Keith Urban respectively.<br>
            <br>
            the charts in Australia, Canada, New Zealand, the United Kingdom, and the United States. Critics praised
            the
            re-recorded album for what they deemed an enhanced production quality that brought a nostalgic feel, but
            some considered vault tracks are insubstantial. Many attributed Swift's enduring popularity to the
            lyrical
            sentiments that appealed to a broad audience, and the media highlighted Fearless (Taylor's Version) as a
            significant event contributing to a wider industry discourse over artists' rights.<br>
