            Red (Taylor's Version) is the second re-recorded album by the American singer-songwriter Taylor Swift,
            released on November 12, 2021, by Republic Records. It is part of Swift's re-recording projects
            following the 2019 dispute over the ownership of her back catalog.<br>
            <br>
            Red (Taylor's Version) includes re-recorded versions of the tracks on Swift's fourth studio album, Red
            (2012), and the 2012 charity single "Ronan"; and nine tracks denoted as "From the Vault":[a] six
            unreleased songs, a 10-minute-long version of "All Too Well", and solo versions of "Better Man" (2016)
            and "Babe" (2018), which Swift had written for other artists. Swift and most original producers reprised
            their works on the re-recorded tracks with additions from Christopher Rowe, and the vault tracks
            featured inputs from Aaron Dessner, Jack Antonoff, Elvira Anderfj√§rd, and Espionage, with features from
            Phoebe Bridgers, Ed Sheeran, and Chris Stapleton.<br>
            <br>
            Music critics described Red (Taylor's Version) as an eclectic album combining styles of pop, country,
            rock, and electronic, featuring various instruments such as acoustic strings and electronic keyboards.
            Its songs address the different dynamics of love and heartbreak. Met with unanimous acclaim, the album
            received critical praise for Swift's vocals, its enhanced production quality, and the vault tracks.
            Commercially, Red (Taylor's Version) topped the charts in Australia, Canada, and the United Kingdom,
            among others. In the United States, it was Swift's fourth number-one on the Billboard 200 in less than
            16 months, registering the shortest time span for an artist to collect four number-one albums.<br>
            <br>
            Swift promoted the album with televised appearances on NBC talk shows and a self-directed short film
            accompanying "All Too Well (10 Minute Version)". Red (Taylor's Version) broke the record for the most
            single-week new entries by an artist with 26 of its tracks charting on the Billboard Hot 100; "All Too
            Well (10 Minute Version)" became the longest chart-topper of all time. The vault tracks "I Bet You Think
            About Me" and "Message in a Bottle" were promoted as radio singles. Publications considered Red
            (Taylor's Version) a key pop culture moment of 2021. The album and its songs received a Billboard Music
            Award, three MTV Video Music Awards, two MTV Europe Music Awards, two American Music Awards, and a
            Grammy Award.<br>
