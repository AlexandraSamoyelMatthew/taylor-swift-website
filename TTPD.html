        The Tortured Poets Department is the eleventh studio album by the American singer-songwriter Taylor
        Swift,
        released on April 19, 2024, by Republic Records. A double album edition, containing a surprise second
        volume
        of
        songs and subtitled The Anthology, was released the same day.<br>
        <br>
        Swift began writing The Tortured Poets Department shortly after finishing her tenth studio album,
        Midnights
        (2022), and continued during the Eras Tour in 2023. She described The Tortured Poets Department as her
        "lifeline" album, conceived amidst intense media scrutiny on her personal life and heightened fame
        brought
        by
        touring. The songs explore her self-awareness and introspections on those events, characterized by
        hyperbolic
        yet humorous lyrics detailing themes of sorrow, fatalism, and melodrama. Produced with Jack Antonoff and
        Aaron
        Dessner, the album is a minimalist synth-pop, chamber pop, and folk-pop effort with rock and country
        stylings.
        The melody is largely midtempo, driven by synthesizers and drum machines alongside piano and guitar.<br>
        <br>
        The album broke various sales and streaming records. It achieved the highest single-day and single-week
        global
        streams for an album on Spotify and topped the charts in territories across Europe, Asia-Pacific, and
        the
        Americas, breaking chart records in Australia, Canada, Germany, and the United Kingdom. In the United
        States,
        The Tortured Poets Department debuted atop the Billboard 200 with first-week 2.6 million
        album-equivalent
        units,
        including 1.9 million pure sales, marking Swift's biggest sales week and record-extending seventh
        release to
        open with over a million units. Its songs made Swift the first artist to monopolize the first 14
        positions
        of
        the Billboard Hot 100, with the lead single "Fortnight" at the top.<br>
        <br>
        The album polarized critics upon release: most reviews praised Swift's cathartic songwriting for its
        emotional
        resonance and wit, but some found it overlong and lacking profundity. Journalists attributed the mixed
        reception
        to Swift's celebrity, which was used by some reviews to prioritize gossip and sensationalism over
        artistic
        evaluation. Some subsequent assessments appreciated the musical and lyrical nuances that emerged upon
        further
        listens.<br>
