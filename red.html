            Red is the fourth studio album by the American singer-songwriter Taylor Swift. It was released on
            October 22,
            2012, by Big Machine Records. The album's title refers to the tumultuous, "red" emotions Swift experienced
            during the album's conception; its songs discuss the complex and conflicting feelings resulting from fading
            romance. <br>

            Hoping to experiment with new sounds beyond her previous albums' country pop style, Swift engaged new
            producers
            Dann Huff, Max Martin, Shellback, Jeff Bhasker, Dan Wilson, Jacknife Lee, Butch Walker, alongside her
            long-time
            collaborator Nathan Chapman. The record combines styles of pop, country, and rock, with eclectic elements
            including arena rock, Britrock, dance-pop, and dubstep. <br>
            Big Machine promoted Red as a country album but many
            critics disputed this categorization and deemed it a pop record. <br>
            The album was supported with seven singles,
            including the US Billboard Hot 100 number-one lead single "We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together" and the
            Mainstream Top 40 number-one single "I Knew You Were Trouble".<br>

            In the US, Red spent seven weeks atop the Billboard 200—making Swift the first female artist and the second
            act after the Beatles to have three consecutive albums each spend at least six weeks at number one—and was
            certified
            seven-times Platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). <br>
            It topped the charts and received
            multi-platinum certifications in Australia, Canada, New Zealand, and the United Kingdom. The album received
            nominations for Album of the Year at the 2013 Country Music Association Awards, and Album of the Year and
            Best
            Country Album at the 2014 Grammy Awards.<br>
            Swift promoted the album with the Red Tour (2013–2014), which
            grossed
            $150 million. <br>

            When it was first released, music critics praised Swift's songwriting in Red but they were divided on the
            album's sonic range; praise was directed at the album's versatility but criticism targeted its
            inconsistency. <br>
            Retrospectively, many critics regard Red one of Swift's best albums and a transitional record bridging her
            country roots to mainstream pop.
            It appeared in publications' lists of the best albums of the 2010s decade
            and ranked at number 99 in the 2023 revision of Rolling Stone's 500 Greatest Albums of All Time. Following a
            dispute regarding the ownership of Swift's back catalog, she re-recorded the album and released it as Red
            (Taylor's
            Version) on November 12, 2021. <br>
