            Midnights is the tenth studio album by the American singer-songwriter Taylor Swift, released on October
            21,
            2022, by Republic Records. Swift conceived it as a concept album about nocturnal ruminations inspired by
            her
            sleepless nights. The autobiographical songwriting explores broad emotions such as regrets,
            self-criticism,
            fantasies, heartbreak, and infatuation, using confessional yet cryptic lyrics that allude to her
            personal life
            and public image.<br>
            <br>
            Swift and Jack Antonoff produced the standard edition of Midnights, which features a subdued electronic
            soundscape consisting of mid-tempo rhythms, retro synthesizers, sparse drum machine beats, and digitally
            manipulated vocals. Music critics categorize the album into pop styles of synth-pop, electropop, dream
            pop, and
            bedroom pop. The songs infuse electronica, hip hop, R&B, and alternative elements. Sounwave, Jahaan
            Sweet, and
            Keanu Beats shared credits on two tracks, and Aaron Dessner produced additional songs for an extended
            3am
            Edition that was surprise-released three hours after the standard edition.<br>
            <br>
            Swift announced Midnights at the 2022 MTV Video Music Awards and unveiled the standard track list via
            the
            video-sharing platform TikTok. Midnights topped the charts across Europe, Asia-Pacific, and the
            Americas. In the
            United States, Midnights was Swift's 11th consecutive number-one album on the Billboard 200, her fifth
            to sell
            over one million first-week copies, and the best-selling album of 2022. Its songs made Swift the first
            artist to
            monopolize the top 10 of the Billboard Hot 100, with the lead single "Anti-Hero" peaking at number one;
            the
            other singles "Lavender Haze" and "Karma" peaked at number two.<br>
            <br>
            Music critics regarded Midnights as an amalgamation of Swift's past albums. They praised her songwriting
            for
            engaging narratives and compositions; most of them complimented the production as restrained and
            tasteful,
            although a few found it derivative. Midnights featured on publications' rankings of the best albums of
            2022 and
            won accolades including Album of the Year and Best Pop Vocal Album at the 66th Annual Grammy Awards
            (2024),
            making Swift the first artist to win the former category four times. Journalists dubbed the album's
            critical and
            commercial successes a testament to Swift's enduring cultural popularity. To support Midnights along
            with her
            other albums, Swift embarked on the Eras Tour (2023–2024).<br>
