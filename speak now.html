    <b style="background-color: rgba(250, 250, 250, 0.329);">they said (until now about her) she cant write her own
        songs<br>
        so she released it in October 25, 2010 the entire album written by hersels when she was only 19</b>
    <p style="background-color: rgba(241, 186, 255, 0.329);">
        From this moment, Taylor began to respond to anyone who doubted her talents and prove to them that they were
        wrong, that she deserves what she is and deserves success.
        Inspired by Swift's transition from adolescence into adulthood
        Speak Now is a loose concept album consisting of confessional songs mostly about love and heartbreak that
        explore past relationships and depart from the youthful optimism on her past albums.
        Some tracks were inspired by her rising stardom and public experience, and they have lyrics about confrontation
        against her critics and adversaries.
        Produced by Swift and Nathan Chapman, the album combines country pop, pop rock, and power pop.
        Its songs incorporate prominent rock stylings, and their melodies are characterized by acoustic instruments
        intertwined with chiming electric guitars, dramatic strings, and drums
