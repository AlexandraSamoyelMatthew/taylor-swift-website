                1989 (Taylor's Version) is the fourth re-recorded album by the American singer-songwriter Taylor
                Swift.
                It is a re-recording of Swift's fifth studio album, 1989 (2014), and was released on October 27,
                2023,
                by Republic Records. The album is part of Swift's ongoing response to a 2019 dispute regarding the
                masters of her back catalog. It was announced at the final Los Angeles show of the Eras Tour on
                August
                9, 2023.<br>

                A 1980s-inspired synth-pop album, 1989 (Taylor's Version) is characterized by upbeat arrangements of
                synthesizers and percussion. It contains re-recorded versions of the 16 songs from 1989's deluxe
                edition
                and five previously unreleased "From the Vault" tracks.[a] Swift, Jack Antonoff, and Christopher
                Rowe
                produced the majority of the album; Ryan Tedder, Noel Zancanella, Shellback, and Imogen Heap
                reprised
                their production roles. Extended editions of the album additionally feature the re-recorded versions
                of
                the One Chance soundtrack song "Sweeter than Fiction" (2013) and the Kendrick Lamar remix of "Bad
                Blood"
                (2015).<br>
                <br>
                Music critics praised 1989 (Taylor's Version), with emphasis on the production, Swift's vocals, and
                the
                vault tracks. Commercially, it earned the biggest streaming day for an album in 2023 on Spotify and
                of
                all time on Amazon Music. The album topped record charts in Australia, Canada, and European
                territories
                including France, Germany, Italy, Spain, and the United Kingdom. In the United States, 1989
                (Taylor's
                Version) marked Swift's 13th number-one album on the Billboard 200, the biggest sales week of her
                career
                to that point, and her record-extending sixth album to sell over one million first-week copies.
                Seven of
                its songs concurrently became top-10 entries on the Billboard Hot 100, with the vault tracks "Is It
                Over
                Now?", "Now That We Don't Talk", and "'Slut!'" occupying the top three spots.<br>
