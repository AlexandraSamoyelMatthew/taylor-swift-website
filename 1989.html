            1989 is the fifth studio album by the American singer-songwriter Taylor Swift, released on October 27, 2014,
            by
            Big Machine Records. Inspired by 1980s synth-pop, Swift conceived 1989 to recalibrate her artistry to pop
            after
            critics disputed her status as a country musician when she released the cross-genre Red (2012) to country
            radio.
            She titled 1989 after her birth year as a symbolic artistic rebirth and enlisted Max Martin, who produced
            Red's
            electronic-influenced pop tracks, as co-executive producer. <br>
            <br>
            Swift recorded 1989 at studios across the United States, the United Kingdom, and Sweden with an ensemble
            including Martin, Shellback, Jack Antonoff, Ryan Tedder, Nathan Chapman, and Imogen Heap. The synth-pop
            production is characterized by pulsing synthesizers, programmed drum machines, and processed backing vocals
            with
            electronic elements, a stark contrast to the acoustic arrangements of Swift's past albums. The songs expand
            on
            Swift's autobiographical songwriting and explore failed romance from a lighthearted perspective.<br>
            <br>
            Swift and Big Machine promoted 1989 extensively through tie-ins and media endorsements but withheld the
            album
            from free streaming services, which prompted an industry discourse on the impact of streaming. To
            support the album, Swift embarked on the 1989 World Tour, which was the highest-grossing tour of 2015. Among
            seven singles released, three peaked atop the US Billboard Hot 100: "Shake It Off", "Blank Space", and "Bad
            Blood". 1989 spent 11 weeks atop the Billboard 200 and was certified nine-times platinum by the Recording
            Industry Association of America (RIAA). It has sold over 14 million copies worldwide and was certified
            multi-platinum in many countries.<br>
            <br>
            When 1989 was first released, music critics generally complimented its production as catchy; they found an
            emotional engagement in its songwriting but some felt the synth-pop production eroded Swift's artistic
            integrityâ€”a criticism that journalists and academics retrospectively regarded as rockist. 1989 won Album of
            the
            Year and Best Pop Vocal Album at the 2016 Grammy Awards, and it was listed in all-time album rankings by
            Rolling
            Stone and Consequence. Critics and academics have considered 1989 an album that transformed Swift's status
            to a
            pop icon and promoted poptimism, but they also highlighted the media scrutiny that ensued. Following a 2019
            dispute regarding the ownership of Swift's back catalog, she re-recorded 1989 and released it as 1989
            (Taylor's
            Version) on October 27, 2023.<br>
