            Evermore is the ninth studio album by the American singer-songwriter Taylor Swift. It was a surprise
            album
            released on December 11, 2020, via Republic Records, less than five months after her previous studio
            album
            Folklore. Evermore was a spontaneous product of Swift's extended collaboration with her Folklore
            collaborator Aaron Dessner, mainly recorded at his Long Pond Studio in the Hudson Valley.<br>
            <br>
            Swift described Evermore as an offshoot of "the folklorian woods"â€”an escapist, cottagecore-inspired
            direction she first ideated with Folklore during the COVID-19 pandemic; she regards them as sister
            albums.
            Evermore blends alternative rock, indie folk and chamber pop styles, carried by fingerpicked guitars,
            somber
            pianos, lavish strings, and sparse percussion. Impressionist storytelling and mythopoeia dominate its
            lyrical technique. The subject matter has been described as an anthology of tales about love, marriage,
            infidelity, and grief, exploring the complexities of human emotion. American bands Bon Iver, Haim, and
            the
            National appear as guest performers on the album.<br>
            <br>
            Earning widespread acclaim from critics, Evermore was praised for its character studies, experimental
            production, and Swift's nuanced vocals. Reviews regarded the album a sequel or a counterpart to
            Folklore,
            and various publications listed it in their 2020 year-end rankings. Evermore was nominated for Album of
            the
            Year at the 64th Annual Grammy Awards, a second consecutive nomination for Swift in the category after
            winning it with Folklore the previous year. Dessner and Long Pond have achieved mainstream notability
            since
            Evermore's release.<br>
            <br>
            The album reached number one in Argentina, Australia, Belgium, Canada, Croatia, Greece, New Zealand,
            Portugal, the United Kingdom, and the United States. Republic Records reported over a million copies of
            Evermore sold in its first week globally. It was Swift's eighth consecutive Billboard 200 number-one
            debut,
            spending four weeks atop the chart, and achieved various chart feats in Australia, the UK and the US; in
            the
            latter, the tracks "Willow", "No Body, No Crime", and "Coney Island" impacted pop, country, and
            alternative
            radio stations, respectively. "Willow" became Swift's seventh Billboard Hot 100 number-one song and her
            second in 2020 after "Cardigan", making her the first ever act to simultaneously debut atop both
            Billboard
            200 and Hot 100 charts two times. Evermore was 2021's best-selling alternative music album and Americana
            album in the US and the UK, respectively.<br>
