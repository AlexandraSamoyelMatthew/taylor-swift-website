                Taylor Swift is the music industry she started writing her own songs since age 12 year old<br>

                fearless album her second one and her first billboard chart was when timcgraw was number 60 in best 100

                you belong with me that we still sing it every crowd in her tours, people said untill now a lot of
                doubts on
                her talent in writing and singing for example they said she cant write er own songs so she released
                speak
                now her thirsd album all of it she wrote from her own it was a country album untill now taylor gets
                Among the best sellers in stores, her international tours have achieved profits exceeding $50 million,
                and
                she is still in her beginnings as a rising artist, receiving awards for favorite artist, favorite young
                artist, etc., and her tours have reached more than twenty countries.<br>
                Taylor was born on December 13, 1989 in Nashville, and her family moved with her to Los Angeles in order
                to
                work his first contract with Scooter Brann before he became the King of Thieves.<br>
                Rumors about her love life started to appear and everyone asked her who she was dating
                In 2008, Taylor was dating Joe Jonas and Selena was dating Nick Jonas, and as a result, they left the
                restaurant holding hands, and they have been friends ever since, and Selena at that time was a Disney
                girl.<br>
            </p>
            <p
                style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans', 'Lucida Sans Regular', 'Lucida Grande', 'Lucida Sans Unicode', Geneva, Verdana, sans-serif; font-size: medium; color: rgb(82, 0, 64); background-color: rgba(240, 248, 255, 0.267);">
                In 2012, Taylor released her fourth album, Red<br>
                And it is an album. Well, it is very sad and very heartbroken, and Taylor slipped her tongue by saying
                that
                the song “All Too Well” is ten minutes long, and we kept asking Taylor to give us this version, but she
                gave
                it to us in 2021 when she released her own version of the album.<br>
                My favorite collaborations along Taylor's career are her collaborations with Ed Sheeran
                Everything Has Changed is a song from which I learned about Ed Sheeran.<br>
                He is a British songwriter and singer who is very creative and I do not feel at all that there is a
                difference between them.<br>
                Red's album was a transition from a dreamy teenage girl to a young woman
                It was nominated for the Grammys for Best Album, but Taylor thought for a moment that she had won it,
                but
                no, because the voice of the person who was announcing the winner was not clear to her at first.<br>
                During this period during Reid's tour, which lasted for approximately two years, they were talking about
                her
                that she was not good at singing anything other than country singing, so when she returned home and woke
                up
                at 3 in the morning, she had a new, completely different idea and a new chapter in her singing life,
                which
                was that she would release a pop album. <br>
            </p>
            <p
                style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans', 'Lucida Sans Regular', 'Lucida Grande', 'Lucida Sans Unicode', Geneva, Verdana, sans-serif; font-size: medium; color: rgb(0, 51, 4); background-color: rgba(240, 248, 255, 0.267);">
                It's called 1989 and you're moving to New York
                Rumors about her love life and her privacy are increasing, and that she puts men in her hands right and
                left, and even if she is meeting someone for the first time for whatever reason, rumors spread and they
                say,
                “Look at Taylor’s new boyfriend.”<br>
                So Taylor released the song “Balnk Space.” She started it as a joke on those who said that about her,
                and
                her life became centered around art and her friends.<br>
                She released the song Shake It Off, one of her best songs in her career
                Of course they criticized her because she only befriends girls with certain characteristics, but they
                are
                lying for the time, I don't know how long it will be.<br>
                The 1989 tour was her biggest tour at the time and one of the best tours in 2015. Since the Speak Now
                tour,
                Taylor has been inviting artists to perform with her, including Jennifer Lopez, Ed Sheeran, Katy Perry,
                Keith Urban, Justin Bieber, Selena Gomez, Wiz Khalifa, and... Justin Timberlake, Lord Wadena, John
                Legend,
                and Fifth Harmony<br>
                And many others<br>

                She has collaborations with other artists, but they are few, such as High Away I Dont Care with Tim
                McGraw
                She sang in the Hunger Games film series<br>
                eyes open, safe and sound I got a Grammy then<br>
                Over the years, she has won many awards, including Woman of the Year in Billboard, Best Female Artist,
                Artist of the Year, and the Award of Excellence. One of her dreams was fulfilled by winning the Grammy
                for
                Album of the Year for the second time, and her speech was very inspiring to me at the time, and I am
                listening to it even now.<br>
                In 2016<br>
                There is a singer named Kanye West who wrote a song about her and called her a bad girl with the b-word
                What happened was that he lied to her and told her that he would mention her name in his song “Famous”
                and
                told her everything, and she agreed, of course. At the Vmas ceremony in 2009, when Taylor won best video
                for
                the song “You Belong with Me,” he rose from the audience and said that Beyoncé has the best. Videos at
                all
                and that Taylor does not deserve the award. Taylor at that time thought that everyone who was cheering
                was
                supporting him. She was not the person she had become in 2015 or during these years. She did not know
                what
                to say at the time and she just started crying, and when Beyoncé received She said that we should
                support
                each other and support emerging talents, and for me, the memory of receiving my first award here was my
                best
                memory ever. Go ahead, Taylor, and live your first moment.<br>
                But well, I call her a fool, and very foolish, when she decided to reconcile with him and he took
                advantage
                of her name in 2015 at Vmas as well, and she got up again and responded to him, but it was often not
                enough
                at that time.<br> </p>
            <p

                In any case, in the year mentioned above, when he called her and lied to her, she knew that he was lying
                when he released the song, and she tried to exonerate herself, but she could not, and Kim Kardashian
                published a fabricated video of her approving the song that was released, not the one he told her about,
                and
                the media became public. <br> Against it
                And she disappeared for a whole year<br>
                Taylor returned in August 2017 with the album Reputation<br>
                It became her best album ever and the best response to anyone who said something bad about her
                The Reputation Tour is among the best tours of 2018<br>
                look what you made me do When we remember her, we say that it is one of the best things that happened,
                and
                that is her return with this new strength and a completely different personality.<br>
            </p>

                But Taylor changed and became better and became a new person. She sought to gain the approval of others
                in all aspects, even her health and body, and now she is living in a much better period, and Reputation
                Tour was something that will never be forgotten.
                In 2019, Taylor founded her own company and began releasing her songs with her own copyrights
                She released the album Lover
                I felt like it was the first time I saw her alive. She was really cheerful and happy. She held many
                shows in the same year and produced the song ME! With Brendon Urie
                Amazon Prime, The Voice France, City of Lover in Paris, a show in Japan, and a show in China
                Lover's album was full of all kinds of love, and it was not limited to the partner, whoever he was
                It was full of butterflies
            </p>

                When she turned 30, she became Billboard's Woman of the Decade and Amas Artist of the Decade
                She said at the Billboard ceremony that she focuses on what people say about her that she cannot do. It
                does not matter what she does. She will do what they think she cannot do and prove to them that they are
                wrong, but this time she is confident in what she is doing.
            </p>

                The movie Miss Americana was released at the beginning of 2020 on the occasion of the elections in
                America, and she talked about everything she went through during the Reputation Tour and recording the
                album, and how she opened her company and the making of the Lover album.
                I always apply all of her advice, but there is completely different advice for me, which is when she
                disappeared for a whole year. She said in the movie that she started writing songs because that was all
                she had to do in that difficult time, and this means that you have to start with what you have, ideas,
                and methods. Everything will come. The important thing is that you start and do not stop your dreams and
                do not give in to depression and your circumstances. At least try, but with sincerity.
            </p>

                In 2020, with the Corona epidemic, Taylor released two albums that saved us that year, but I was
                enjoying the home quarantine anyway. The first album was called Folklore and she released it in the
                month of July.
                The second is Evermore, which was released in December
                In between this period, she released a documentary album about how she recorded folklore while at home,
                and explained the stories in each song with Jack Antonoff and Aaron Dincer.
                Taylor has proven that she can sing any color, any style, she can write at any time, she writes stories
                about imaginary characters, her friends, and stories from her life. Her albums talk about her and
                everything important in her life, and every feeling she feels, she turns it into music, and we cry and
                laugh. We clap and sing with her in all circumstances. She also describes our feelings and situations we
                go through with many people in our lives, and she has won many other awards.
                She has many accomplishments, yes, but her biggest accomplishment was when she made us wear cardigans in
                the summer
                I don't know how she did it, but she did it.
            </p>

                In 2021, Taylor won the Album of the Year award at the Grammys and became the first artist in history to
                win it three times over three decades, and the Writer of the Year and Artist of the Year at the BRITs.
                She then said, "We live in a world where everyone has the potential to say something bad about you. What
                we have to do is prove them wrong."
                The album Fearless released its own version, Taylor's Version
                And previously unreleased songs called from the vault
                In October, Reed was released, along with all too well 10 min version Taylor's version from the vault.

                At the beginning of 2022, not actually at the beginning, in April, Ed Sheeran released his song “The
                Joker and the Queen” with Taylor, and the first version on his album = We all thought he had written it
                about Taylor, and the result is yes, and they sang it again.
                In March - perhaps - Taylor received an honorary doctorate in art from New York University, and her
                speech at that time was very inspiring, even until now, and it became for me her second favorite speech,
                and the first was when she won the Grammys in 2016 for Album of the Year for her album 1989.
